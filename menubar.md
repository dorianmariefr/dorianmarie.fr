## Apple icon

I use a Macbook Air as my personal laptop, with macOS.

I could remove this icon by hiding the menu bar for instance but it's
important, it lets me access my system information, my storage space,
all all the settings mainly.

## Application menu

It's not a coincidence that this is the Terminal, that's where I spend
most of my time when I'm not on Chrome, and that's where I write code
which is my main activity.

I don't use the menu very often, I would say I either go to the Preferences
or go to Help and search for what I'm trying to do.

If I would use something regularly I would make a shortcut for it.

Shortcuts in macOS are based on menu item labels and using search in Help will
locate the menu item visually for me, very nice.

## Tray icons

All those tray icons start when my Mac starts. By default I just let the icons be and let them do their job.

- **Cloudflare WARP**: A free and simple VPN that lets me use the internet always over
  secure connections
  - I will occasionnaly switch WARP on and off when the internet is not working, not sure why, didn't investigate
- **Redis.app**: I find it works better than having a backround service, here I can visually see when redis is running
  - Redis is a database I use for caching, background jobs, and websockets through Action Cable in my Ruby on Rails appas
- **Postgres.app**: Same as Redis.app, better than a background service because I see when it's running, I can see the version. I will rarely use Postico to see the tables and data inside the database
  - Postgres (short for PostgreSQL) is a database that works very well, is reliable and has a lot of features including search
- **Music**: I listen to music on Apple Music now, switched from Spotify a few days ago and it works well and is much nicer. I like to be surrounded by well-designed apps, I think it influences my own design and taste.
- **Spectable**: I use it for shotcuts like Command+Option+Right to put a window on the right half of my screen (often of Terminal), Command+Option+Left to put a window on the left half of my screen (rare), Command+Option+f for doing a full-screen (without switching to macOS full screen that hides the menu bar) (often for Chrome)
- **KeepingYouAwake**: It keeps my Mac awake while I listen to music or download files. Kind of an issue sometimes because it seems like it keeps the Mac awake when the lid is closed
- **Bluetooth**: Great when it works to connect speakers
- **Sound**: I use the keyboard shortcuts to adjust the volume but this works too
- **Wifi**: Connect to the internet over Wifi, pretty useful
- **Battery**: Should look at it more
- **Controls**: Never use that
- **Date and time**: Pretty useful
