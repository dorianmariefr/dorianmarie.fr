### Paris to Portland

I took three planes to get me to Portland by Monday 16th (one day before the
conference starts)

On my first night I met up with an old friend, [Nick
Urban](https://www.nickurban.com).

### First day

I woke up a bit late and missed the opening keynote.

When I arrived the keynote was finished and people were talking outside the
ballroom.

The first person I recognized was Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove, Ruby
and Rails core team member and overall funny person).

Then I met up with Chris Oliver (of GoRails fame) and Schneems (of Heroku fame).

Then I went to
[Rails 7 Front End Tooling](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-1300)
workshop where I learned more about using Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), especially
the Turbo frames part.

Then I went for lunch and met and talked with a few people.

After lunch I went to [Advanced Active Record - Building a composable query
builder](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-1280) but the room was
more than full and it was quite hard to follow while seating on the floor.

So I left and went home to sleep for the afternoon.

I came back just in time for Aaron Patterson's keynote.

Then I didn't know where to go (it looked like the events were fully booked) so
I stayed outside and waited to see anybody I recognize.

I recognized [Schwad](https://twitter.com/schwad_rb), [Andrew
Mason](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes) and
[Roman](https://twitter.com/schmope).

Then Roman invited me to a bar where the Turing School was organizing an
afterhour.

I went there and won a mug for being the person who traveled the furthest. I
also met people who wanted to come work at thoughtbot. Then another bar and then
home ü§ó.

### Second day

Woke up late again and missed the keynote, then came and hung out in the Exhibit
Hall where all the sponsors had booths.

I talked to most of the people at the booths but my favorite was the Sidekiq /
HoneyBadger one where there were couches to sit.

Then after I grabbed some lunch, I sat with [Brittany
Martin](https://twitter.com/brittjmartin), [Andrea
Fomera](https://twitter.com/afomera) and Schwad.

After, I went to Test Double Lab where we paired on [a pull request on
Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45104) and I got some rubber ducks.

Then I noticed, very lucky, that there were lightning talks starting in the
adjacent room so I went there and watched the talks. Next time I will definitely
give at least a lightning talk.

Then I was heading out to the Sidekiq lounge when I saw it was happy hour. Got a
drink and got talking with folks.

I was just sitting in the Sidekiq lounge drinking and talking when I got invited
to ride in a limo to go watch a movie. It was organized by [Andrew
Culver](https://twitter.com/andrewculver).

After that we hung out on the rooftop of the hotel and there was Go Rails folks
and I met [Marco Roth](https://twitter.com/marcoroth_).

Then back home üò¥.

### Third day

I'm a bit ashamed but third day I slept most of the day üòÖ. When I came back it
was the end of the keynote.

Then I went to bars with folks.

### Conclusion?

Loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è would do it again, see you in Atlanta next year!
